The CSP program is currently rolling out at scale and many service providers are embarking on the journey to provide management infrastructure services for their customers. In addition to the first article about Identity in CSP, we will show more tricks from the field.

While the scale is rapidly increasing the ask for operational optimization increases as well for these managed service providers as they have to integrate these newly acquired environments under their existing tools and provide same levels of service management as they used to provide within their on-premises environments.
The objective of this post is to provide a set of guidance that will help CSP partners, offering managed services, to optimize their operations by reducing the surface and impact of human errors or in other words: Identity Management and RBAC in the world of a CSP managed services provider

The goal is to increase the level of control, insight and automation, which will lead to staff optimization and a higher level of services provided by the Cloud Solution Provider.
